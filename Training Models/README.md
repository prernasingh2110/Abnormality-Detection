MURA_MAIN.py contains a VGG-16 model that classifies the x-rays into different types of bones.
X-Rays of each type of bone are further trained on an inception model.
Here only EXP_MURA2.py (which trains X-Ray images of Wrist) is shown. Model for all types of bones is same. Only the path where the X-Ray images reside changes.
